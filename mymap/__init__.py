""" Create a minimal Django application that does the following:

* Model a (Bike)route (as a polylinestring)
* Allow simple CRUD operations via an API endpoint
* Display the route via a django view
* Add as many (fun) features as you like :)
* Bonus points for writing API tests (pytest)

Goals:

Write clean, well documented, understandable code that others will enjoy to read (try to keep the wtf/minute rate low)
Show us how you approach, disect and model a problem/solution
Document your workflow by making many commits
Use type hinting
Take as much or as little time as you'd like (see the first 2 Goals)
Have fun

Non-Goals:

Creating a fully functional, production ready prototype
Wasting your valuable time
Not having fun

REFACTOR:
Yes, do it !
Change ' into " to have uniform literals. I do like " as in most other programming languages!
EXTEND testing classes. The team will provide more cases, I am sure.
